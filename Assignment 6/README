Aim was to create a simple web server listening on port 8787.

There is one endpoint '/hash' which accepts a POST request that contains JSON encoded data in the following format:
{
    "data": "<a string>"
}

The endpoint calculates the SHA-256 hash of the given string, converts it to hexadecimal representation, and returns it in the following format as JSON encoded data:
{
    "hash": "hexadecimal representation of the SHA-256 hash of the given string"
}


If a POST request is made on http://localhost:8787/hash with the JSON body:
{
    "data": "Mandar Wayal"
}
This returns:
{
  "hash": "5a9fdc35573cd194cf3e3b55489d2b12d24f101c3f43ba5171b1b42dc6e5587f"
}
