This project was offered by Association for Computing Activities (ACA), IIT Kanpur to first-year UG students. 

## [Assignment 1](./Assignment%201)

It was based on finding the nonce for a given string. We had to write a program that takes some data as string input. Then it tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target, which is      
`0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`
The [code](./Assignment%201/Assignment_1.js) logs the required nonce and the final hash of the string for you!
